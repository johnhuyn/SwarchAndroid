**Needs to be able to connect and send username and password(IMPLEMENTED)**

**Should return a message / deny connection if username and password do not match(IMPLEMENTED BUT NEEDS TO BE DEBUGGED)**

**While not needed for this milestone having the server detect the client disconnecting is required for the final milestone(IMPLEMENTED NOT USED YET)**

-**Add database to store usernames and password on server(IMPLEMENTED JUST DEBUG)**

-**Create database on the server(IMPLEMENTED)**

-**If a connection is attempted retrieve said username/password to check(IMPLEMENTED)**

-**If player doesn't exist in database create a new player with that password(IMPLEMENTED NEED DEBUG)**
