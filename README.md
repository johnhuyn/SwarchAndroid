Milestone 1: COMPLETED

Milestone 2: COMPLETED

Milestone 3: IN PROGRESS

**What needs to be done**

-**Add network layer to the game to establish handshake (connection / verification of player information)**

-Needs to be able to connect and send username and password

-Should return a message / deny connection if username and password do not match

-While not needed for this milestone having the server detect the client disconnecting is required for the final milestone 

-**Add database to store usernames and password on server**

-Create database on the server

-If a connection is attempted retrieve said username/password to check.

-If player doesn't exist in database create a new player with that password

-There should probably be a confirmation pop up somewhere that states this not to confused player

-Lastly a true/false should be sent from server->client to switch our thing after user authentication has been approved.
